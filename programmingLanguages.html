  <h1>Programming Languages We Offer</h1>
  <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the three languages we offer</p>
  <h2>HTML</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="HTML1-col">
      <h4>HTML</h4>
      <p> ► HTML is the abbreviation for Hyper Text Markup Language.
        <br> ► HTML is a markup language that is used to create web pages.
        <br> ► The structure of a Web page is described in HTML.
        <br> ► HTML is made up of a number of different elements.
        <br> ► HTML elements specify how the material should be displayed in the browser.
        <br> ► HTML is one of the most common languages to design websites.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="HTML1-col">
    <h4>HTML Introduction</h4>
    <p> ► This document is an HTML5 document, as indicated by the!DOCTYPE html> declaration.
        <br> ► The root element is the html> element.
        <br> ► The HTML page's meta information is contained in the head> element.
        <br> ► The title> element gives the HTML page a title.
        <br> ► The body> element serves as a container for all visible information.
        <br> ► A heading is defined using the h1> element. A paragraph is defined by the p> element.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="HTML1-col">
  <h4>HTML Elements</h4>
  <p> ► A start tag, some content, and an end tag define an HTML element:
  <br> ► This an example of  HTML element < tagname> Content < /tagname>.
  <br> ► < h1> Heading	< /h1> - This a heading tag used for titles.
  <br> ► < p> paragraph.	< /p> - This is a paragraph tag used to write text in.
  <br> ► < br> - This breaks the line so text doesn't overflow.
  <br> ► The < a> element in HTML is used to define links.
 </p>
</div>
</section>

<section class="HTML">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="HTML2-col">
      <h4>HTML Elements</h4>
      <p> ► The < div> tag is to divide your HTML code.
      <br> ► You are also able to give your div a class name by doing < div class
      ="(name)". This can be then referenced in a CSS file to design.
      <br> ► Section is a tag similar to div, however its more broader where as
      div is more specific as a section just sections off a document. < section> is the
      starting tag and </ section> is the closing tag.
      <br> ► < script> allows you to add any programming.
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="HTML2-col">
    <h4>HTML Attributes</h4>
    <p> ► width="" height=""> - You are able to
      add a width and height of an image/text to your desired size.
      <br> ► alt="(info)" - Adding alt into the img src element tag will allow you
      to provide information if the picture doesn't load. So if I showcasing football,
      I would add football so if it doesn't load users can still see its a football.
      <br> ► < style> - Will allow you to design it, so you would be able to add colour.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="HTML2-col">
  <h4>HTML Attributes</h4>
  <p> ► lang="en"> - Lang stands for language, which allows you to set the language
    for your webpage, in this example I've selected English.
    <br> ►The href attribute gives the hyperlink's destination page's URL. Upon clicking on it will
    allow the user to be redirected to that corresponding page.
    <br> ► href attributes are good for creating navigation bars
    <br> ► align will allow you to align your text the way you want. so align: center; will
    center the text.

<section class="HTML">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="HTML3-col">
      <h4>HTML</h4>

      <h4>CSS</h4>
      <p>    ► Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is an acronym for CSS.
        <br> ►  CSS specifies how HTML components should appear on a screen, in print, or in other media.
        <br> ►  CSS helps you save time and effort. It has the ability to control the layout of numerous web pages at the same time.
        <br> ►  CSS files include external stylesheets which are referenced in the HTML file using a link tag.
       </p>
  </div>
  <div class="CSS1-col">
    <h4>CSS</h4>
    <p> ► CSS is used to specify the design, layout, and display variants for different devices and screen sizes on your web pages.
      <br> ► When features like colour attributes were added to the HTML,
            it made web developing difficult.  The creation of large websites, where attributes were added to each page,
            took a long time and was difficult to comprehend. CSS was designed to address this issue.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="CSS1-col">
  <h4>CSS</h4>
  <p> ► A style sheet can be inserted in one of three ways: external, internal and inline.
      <br> ► External style sheet is one sheet that changes the design of the entire website.
      <br> ► The internal style is defined within the head section's < style> element.
      <br> ► An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

<h3> How to Incoporate all three to create a website </h3>
<p>The first step is to open the HTML document. This is where you begin to add your website's content. So, for instance, I began with the title of my website and the image that would serve as my backdrop. I moved on to the CSS file after I had all of the material I wanted to include in my website. I used the CSS file as a reference in my HTML file at first.
You start designing the website in the CSS file, so that's where I determined what font to use, what colour to use, what backdrop to use, how large everything should be, and where and how the orientation should be. I was also able to incorporate some affects into my CSS code, such as adding a shadow or a hover effect.
Then, if necessary, you'd go on to the JavaScript, although some basic websites don't require any JavaScript at all. So, if you needed JavaScript, you'd make a separate JS file and reference it in the HTML page the same way you did with the CSS file. Subsequently I'd write my code in the JS file, which would then apply to the HTML file.
Allowing your button that was included in the HTM file to be clicked to the right and desired page is a simple example of adding a JS file. I utilised JavaScript across my website; one example of where it was used was in a menu designed for smaller devices. On smaller devices, customers would be able to click the menu, which would bring up the navigation bar, and then click the X button to conceal it. This is the most straightforward method of combining all three in order to construct a website.</p>

<h3> Other Useful Programming Languages </h3>
<h6>Python</h6>
<p>Python is one of the most user-friendly programming languages. Python may be used to construct a framework for almost any website requirement. This language has a basic syntax that makes it easier for web developers to work with and explain to their consumers. Pinterest and Instagram are two examples of sites that use this terminology. Web developers who want to use Python to create a flexible web development environment. Python makes use of a large number of common libraries to make the development process easier.</p>
<h6>Java</h6>
<p> One of the most widely used programming languages is Java. It's used to create content for websites, games, applications, and software. The majority of Android apps are written in Java. According to studies, Java is used on approximately 15 billion devices in some way or another. The Java programming language is portable and may be used on a variety of software systems. For server-side development, web developers utilise the Java programming language. Java may be used to generate interactive dynamic web pages.</p>
<h6>SQL</h6>
<p> SQL is a database query language that is used to process massive volumes of data on your website. SQL allows you to acquire information from several databases and tailor your website to your target audience. This language isn't utilised by itself; rather, it's used in conjunction with others to get the most out of your customer database and website development.</p>
<h6>PHP</h6>
<p> PHP is frequently used for data-intensive websites and app development. This is an open-source language that may be readily customised to suit your company's or website's demands. PHP is used to organise and process data on large websites like WordPress and Facebook. It's a server-side scripting language that makes it easy to create fully working websites and apps.</p>
<h6>.NET</h6>
<p>.NET is a programming framework that may be used to create a broad range of applications, including online, mobile, and Windows-based applications. C#, VB.NET, C++, and F# are some of the programming languages that may be used with the.NET framework. We utilise both C# and MVC at Grand Circus. The.NET Framework has a large number of predefined class libraries (pre-written code) that handle both simple and complicated data structures.</p>
